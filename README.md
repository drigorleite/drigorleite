👋 Hello! I'm Rodrigo Leite (@drigorleite)
I'm a Brazilian developer currently studying Applications Development at Lake Michigan College here in the United States. I’m passionate about coding, tennis, and spending quality time with family.

🎾 Love a good match on the tennis court and the thrill of solving complex coding challenges.

🎓 Focused on not just graduating, but making a real difference—I’m here to create something impactful, not just fill a role.

🤝 Always open to collaborating with other devs, sharing insights, and learning together.
